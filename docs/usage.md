### Generate Callgraph
Uses static analysis to generate the callgraph of the application and its dependent libraries.

```bash
./syspart -p $BINARY -s $MAIN -a 1
```
Where `$BINARY` is the name of the binary and `$MAIN` is the name or address of the function from which the callgraph is computed (usually `main()`). The address should be provided in hexadecimal and should start with `0x`.

By default, all indirect calls target the AT functions. The `-i` option performs the FCG refining of SysPart (prune AT list and resolve indirect calls).
For more options, refer to:

```bash
./syspart --help
```

### Dynamic Library Profiling
Determines the names of libraries and functions loaded using `dlopen()` and `dlsym()` through a combination of static and dynamic analyses.

#### Determine the `dlopen` and `dlsym` Function Names
In the tested environment (Ubuntu 18.04 and libc-2.27), the `dlopen` and `dlsym` functions are in `libdl.so` with names `dlopen@@GLIBC_2.2.5` and `dlsym`. Please verify and update `analysis/app/src/dlanalysis/dlopen.txt` and `analysis/app/src/dlanalysis/dlsym.txt` with the correct names in your environment.

#### Static Analysis
```bash
cd analysis/app/src/dlanalysis/static
./run_dlanalysis.sh $BINARY $OUTPUT_DIR
```
Where `$BINARY` is the name of the binary and `$OUTPUT_DIR` is the output directory for the files. This script uses value-flow analysis (VFA) and stores the results in `dlopen_static.txt` and `dlsym_static.txt`. Each line contains the function invoking `dlopen`/`dlsym`, the callsite address, and the passed argument.

If values flowing into `dlsym()` call sites are resolved, but not those to `dlopen()`, the system searches for libraries exporting the resolved symbols. All matching libraries are potential `dlopen()` inputs, listed in `libraries_matching_syms.txt` in the output folder. It's recommended to add application-specific folders to the file `analysis/app/src/dlanalysis/pathlist.txt` as dependent libraries might reside in those paths.

#### Dynamic Analysis
For verification, dynamic analysis captures the runtime arguments to `dlopen` and `dlsym`.

```bash
cd analysis/app/src/dlanalysis/dynamic/fninterposition
make
LD_PRELOAD=./libmydl.so $APP_RUN_COMMAND
```
If the application requires root permissions, use:

```bash
sudo LD_PRELOAD=./libmydl.so $APP_RUN_COMMAND
```

Results are saved in `output/fninterp_$pid.txt`, where `$pid` is the process ID. To process these results:

```bash
./process_output.sh output/ $OUTPUT_FOLDER
```

This produces `fninter_dlopen.txt` and `fninterp_dlsym.txt` in `$OUTPUT_FOLDER`, containing the arguments to `dlopen()` and `dlsym()`, respectively. It also moves `fninterp_$pid.txt` files from `output/` to `$OUTPUT_FOLDER`.
